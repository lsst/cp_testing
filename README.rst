``cp_testing`` is a package in the `LSST Science Pipelines <https://pipelines.lsst.io>`_.

.. Add a brief (few sentence) description of what this package provides.

This package supplies alternate pipeline definitions for calibration production that allow multiple calibration steps to be run from a single pipeline.  This is not intended for the production of calibrations for science processing.  Rather it is designed to allow the processing of a single large calibration set (such as the Camera Team B Protocol runs) so that camera performance can be examined.
